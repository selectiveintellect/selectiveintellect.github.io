# Selective Intellect was at DARPA I2O's Demo Day

Monday, May 26 2014.

Our [DARPA Cyber Fast
Track (CFT)](https://www.fbo.gov/spg/ODA/DARPA/CMO/DARPA-RA-11-52/listing.html) projects
[Firecracker](http://www.selectiveintellect.net/select-projects/) and
[Bootjack](http://www.selectiveintellect.net/select-projects/) were selected for
demonstration at the [DARPA I2O Demo
Day](http://www.darpa.mil/NewsEvents/Releases/2014/05/21.aspx) at the Pentagon
on May 22. We had two separate presentation booths with Firecracker being in the
_Restricted_ section for security cleared personnel and Bootjack in the
unclassified section.

Overall it was a fantastic experience demonstrating the technologies we had
developed to various defense personnel who were genuinely interested in how
things worked. This event gave us an opportunity to interact with the other
performers of the CFT program and view their research in detail. Most of the
performers were purely-research oriented companies like ours. Some projects by
the performers used novel technologies like the [Oculus
Rift](http://www.google.com) to visualize large
scale _simulated_ cyber attacks which was definitely a mind-blowing experience
to see it in 3D.

We look forward to collaborating with some of these companies in the future and
working on more novel research ideas with DARPA.
